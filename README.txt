Mail send problems

  If you have problems with the emails distribution and one of these two problems:
  - send emails with empty body
  - send emails with incomplete text in the body
 
  You can resolve this issue by changing a few items in the file ./system/helpers/func_main.php
  Go to line 126 and delete all lines that contain the phrase (DELETE_THIS_LINE):
  
  ----------------------------------------------
  /*  (DELETE_THIS_LINE) This is a fix for everybody with mail issues (2 types)
      (DELETE_THIS_LINE) 1. Your script send mails with blank body
      (DELETE_THIS_LINE) 2. Your script send mails with missing text in the mail body
               
      (DELETE_THIS_LINE) To activate the fix delete all the lines which contains (DELETE_THIS_LINE).
 
	do_send_mail($email, $subject, $message_txt, $from);
	return;
 
   (DELETE_THIS_LINE)*/
  ----------------------------------------------        
  
  Once you have deleted the lines you should have only the following code left:
 
  ----------------------------------------------
   do_send_mail($email, $subject, $message_txt, $from);
   return;
